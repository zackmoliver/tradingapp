Adaptive Intelligence Module Tests

This package contains comprehensive tests for the adaptive intelligence module,
including unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks.

Test Structure:
- Unit tests for core types and components
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Performance tests for optimization and pattern recognition
- Mock data fixtures for deterministic testing
- Coverage requirements matching engine modules

All tests use deterministic fixtures and prohibit external network calls
to ensure reproducible and reliable test execution in CI/CD environments.
